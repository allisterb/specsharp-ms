# About
This is a continuation of the [Spec#](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/spec/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/spec/) project from Microsoft. The code is from
the last CodePlex release which is only available now on [archive.org](https://archive.org/download/sylirana_ms_codeplex_zips). The main compiler and libraries have been updated to run on .NET Framework 4.x
so it should be able to run in any compatible environment. You'll need to add your own [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) executable; any recent version should do.
